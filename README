setup.sh
----------------------------------------
Run setup.sh from the directory containing it for base setup. This will install
useful packages and copy config files to your home directory.

After installing packages, it will prompt for your email to fill in that part of
the git config, and then it will prompt for your password in order to change
your shell to zsh.


dwm-setup.sh
----------------------------------------
Run dwm-setup.sh (with sudo -E) to set everything up for X and dwm.

NOTE: make sure to run the dwm script with sudo -E so that it gets sudo'd but
puts stuff in the right home directory
